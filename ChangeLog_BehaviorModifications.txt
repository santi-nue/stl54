2010/09/25  Prf : erase all data created during a function

All variable/fields created during a function
 are erased at the end of the function.

They are still visible/usable inside wireshark,
 but you can NOT use them into fdesc format description.


Example, with the following function :

  function void  function_name ()
  {
    uint16        an_integer_field;
    var string    a_string_variable = "content";
  }


Call the function :

  call function_name  ();

  if (an_integer_field == 0)           # FATAL : an_integer_field does NOT exist
  {
    ...
  }

  if (a_string_variable == "content")  # FATAL : a_string_variable does NOT exist
  {
    ...
  }
